# Brain Tumor Classifier

This is a web application built using **Flask** for the diagnosis of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (using **AChorDS-LVQ**). It has been trained on the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset), containing four types of brain tumors: 
- glioma
- meningioma
- no tumor
- pituitary.

and achieved 99.7 (+0.1) accuracy. 

The app predicts what type of brain tumor is in an image. In addition to the prediction, it also visualizes a heatmap, capturing the effect of each pixels on the model decision (in a form of heatmap).

__Note:__ Its docker image, consisting of the model, can be found in: `mohammadimathstar/brain-tumor-app:0.1.1`

## Features

- **Prediction**: Classify the type of the brain tumor in the input image.
- **Visualization**: Displays the influence of pixels on the model's prediction.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Upload an image (or a url of an image), and receive immediate predictions and visualizations.
  
## Requirements

To run this app locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The requirements.txt file includes the necessary dependencies like Flask, Matplotlib, and other libraries required for the app.


### Model Preparation

To use the app, you need to put a trained model in a directory `models`. Follow these steps:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/housing-eviction-predictor.git](https://github.com/mohammadimathstar/BrainTumorApp.git)
cd BrainTumorApp
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open your browser and go to:

```arduino
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

5. Upload an MRI image, and submit the form. The app will display the prediction and visualisations of the most influential pixels and region.


## File Format

The input image should be a (.jpg) file. The app will process this image to predict what type of tumor is present in the image.

## Example

This is the visualisation generated for an image:

![plot](./samples/example.png)
